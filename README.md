Relationship betweem Signal energy and distance: The power of the signal can be estimated by resolving audio signal into its frequency components;
the energy corresponding to the driving frequency is considered to carry huge chunk of the energy being transported by the audio signal.
The energy of the signal is found to be have an inverse relationship with distance of the noise source from the microphone. We will try to expolit
this inverse relationship to comeup with a model that will help us to localize a noise source.
